Nowadays, during the life of one person, technology can change several times. Now it's Spotify that allows you to listen to music for a fee. **All this has happened in the last 30 years.** In the next 30 years, much more will happen and it will "help" in this, among other things, artificial intelligence. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence



Contrary to appearances, the term "artificial intelligence" appeared already in the 1950s.  Yet In one of his publications, Alan Turing (a British scientist) wondered whether A machine can think?  The question is quite complicated.  As far as the first word - "The machine" is relatively easy to define, the second one, which is - "think" it's very difficult to define.  Turing proposed to approach this task from another pages.  If a machine behaves similarly as a human being, then we can conclude that can "think".  This is how the Turing Test was defined.
