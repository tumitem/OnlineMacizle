Is it supposed to be just many hours of work, but completed in any way? Or maybe not the hours are important, but the final effect? It is worth to be more precise. 

The Esport Streamer is NOT a job for you because

\- is a powerful deterrent to doing something else.

Those who aren't really fit for such a job, and at the same time encourage those who can do well in it. For example: "It's not a job for you if you're looking for a remote job to pretend you're working." 

The issue of remuneration : it is to consider putting a fork in our minds. What do we want to achieve? How will it affect our lives, Is playing is a plan for our whole life ? . It narrows down the circle of applying phoenixes to help you and discourages those who would like to work for e.g. twice as much. It is worth adding this point to save time for both yours and the candidates.
